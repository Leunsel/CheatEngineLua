# Cheat Engine Lua Modules

This repository contains a collection of Lua modules tailored for Cheat Engine to streamline and enhance the process of customizing Cheat Tables. These modules offer tools for automating tasks, managing memory records, interacting with game processes, and more. By leveraging these modules, you can accelerate table creation *(and hopefully improve the efficiency and robustness of your Cheat Tables)*.

Whether you're handling memory records, automating the auto-assembly process, or managing UI components, these modules provide the functionality to create more dynamic and feature-rich Cheat Tables.
